**This is an unfinished experiment to learn more about using dotnet.**

# OrangeOrchardApp
Modification and extension of the Movie app created with ASP.net core, following the Microsoft tutorials for dotnet.

Current Goal: An index of Orange trees in an Orchard. Orange trees can be created, removed and viewed. The view will show an 3D orange tree model on an AR marker (currently the hiro marker), with oranges around it that can be 'picked' and added to the total oranges picked. Each orange tree will grow according to its age and produce a different number of oranges.
